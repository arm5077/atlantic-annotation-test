# The Atlantic's annotation bookmarklet hack
We have a annotation tool we think is neat. Before we implement in our CMS, we want to make sure our readers and our reporters agree.

## How to use it
# Grab the bookmarklet
Head over to [this page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/the-atlantic/annotations/bookmarklet.html) and drag the bookmarklet to your toolbar.

#Select the text
Select the text you want to annotate in Ollie, and click the bookmarklet. It'll drop in an annotation box, where you can write to your heart's content!

You can even create a footnote _within_ a footnote â€” though you should only seriously consider this if you're David Foster Wallace.
